# Module 3

I have provided you with data about mortality from all 50 states and the District of Columbia.

Please access it at [https://github.com/charleyferrari/CUNY_DATA608/tree/master/module3/data](https://github.com/GitableGabe/CUNY_DATA_608/tree/master/module3/data)

You are invited to gather more data from our provider, [the CDC WONDER system](https://wonder.cdc.gov/ucd-icd10.html).

* This assignment must be done in R. It must be done using the ‘shiny’ package.
* It is recommended you use an R package that supports interactive graphing such as
plotly, or vegalite, but this is not required.
* Your apps must be deployed, I won’t be accepting raw files. Luckily, you can pretty
easily deploy apps with a free account at shinyapps.io

## Shiny Apps Examples

## Question 1:
    As a researcher, you frequently compare mortality rates from particular causes across
    different States. You need a visualization that will let you see (for 2010 only) the
    crude mortality rate, across all States, from one cause (for example, Neoplasms, which
    are effectively cancers). Create a visualization that allows you to rank States by 
    crude mortality for each cause of death.
    
    
```{r}
ui <- fluidPage(
  titlePanel("Crude Mortality Rate Across All States by Causes"), 
      sidebarLayout(
        selectInput("select", label = h3("Causes of Death"), 
                    choices = cdc$ICD.Chapter, 
                    selected = 1,
                    width = '100%'),
        
        mainPanel(
           plotOutput("distPlot")
        )
    )
)

server <- function(input, output) {
    output$distPlot <- renderPlot({
      ggplot(cdc[cdc$ICD.Chapter == input$select,] , aes(x = reorder(State, Crude.Rate), y = Crude.Rate)) +
        labs(x = "State", y = "Crude Mortality Rate") +  
        geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
        coord_flip() +
        theme_minimal()
    }, width = 'auto', height = 'auto')
}

shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```


## Question 2:
    Often you are asked whether particular States are improving their mortality rates (per
    cause) faster than, or slower than, the national average. Create a visualization that
    lets your clients see this for themselves for one cause of death at the time. Keep in
    mind that the national average should be weighted by the national population.
